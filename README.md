# Alternative Web Browsers

## Graphical

* [Basilisk](https://www.basilisk-browser.org/) - a free and open source XUL-based web browser based on Goanna engine (which is a fork of Gecko with deliberately removed Rust-based components and multiprocess browsing)
* [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) - an experimental peer-to-peer Web browser based on Chromium which can **host websites**
* [Falkon](https://www.falkon.org/) - a lightweight web browser **based on QtWebEngine**
* [SharpBrowser](https://github.com/sharpbrowser/SharpBrowser) - supposedly **fastest Chromium based browser** due to usage of lightweight and high-pefromance CEF renderer called [CefSharp](http://cefsharp.github.io/).
* [Viper](https://github.com/LeFroid/Viper-Browser) - a lightweight web browser **based on QtWebEngine**

## Text

* [browsh](https://www.brow.sh/) - "a fully-modern text-based browser. It renders anything that a modern browser can; HTML5, CSS3, JS, video and even WebGL. Its main purpose is to be run on a remote server and accessed via SSH/Mosh or the in-browser HTML service in order to significantly reduce bandwidth and thus both increase browsing speeds and decrease bandwidth costs"
* [eww](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html) - "Emacs Web Browser"
